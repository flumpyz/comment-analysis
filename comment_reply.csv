Monolith is arctic white and blue.
Mercenary is navy blue.
Loner has no specific colour but usually dull green, gray-red and gray-green.
Bandits are either tan-brown or edgy black.
Ecologists vary as well but they're bright orange/mild blue.
Military goes for lively camo green, usually brighter than loners.
Clear Sky shares the same colours with Monolith, but with more blue. If you know the ending of CS, then it makes sense.",2021-06-13T19:40:53Z,1
